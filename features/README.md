Features
========

The `.feature` files in here represent the features I'm currently
working on. I may be finished with some, and I may not have started work
on others, but these are the current picture of what I'm thinking about.

In case you the reader are unfamiliar with [cucumber][1], these files
are also runnable tests, with definitions in the `steps/` directory and
additional support code in `support/`.

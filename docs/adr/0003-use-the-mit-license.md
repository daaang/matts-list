# 3. Use the MIT License for this project

Accepted

## Context

Personally, I'm inclined to always use the beerware license, but it's
literally a joke, and who knows where this project might go. So, I'd
like to use something that isn't a joke.

If I'm being serious, I like the GPLv3 license on principle. That said,
this isn't a software project that many people are likely to actually
use. It's a software project with the expected use that a single website
will actually deploy the software, and its source is open so that issues
and features can be publicly tracked.

With web projects (e.g. NPM packages, rails), my impression is that the
MIT License is the most widely used. It differs from the GPLv3 in that
it does allow someone to fork this project into something proprietary,
but (a) it doesn't actually bother me if someone does that, and, (b) if
someone is able to cause harm by forking a closed source version, I
highly doubt I'll be able to stop them with a txt file and what little
influence I have over any particular judicial system.

In short, I can go with my heart (beerware), with my mind (GPLv3), or
with my observations of related communities (MIT).

## Decision

I'll use the MIT License for this project.

Security Policy
===============

This project is still in active development and I'm not even pretending
that it's ready for a production deployment. I don't support any version
of the software, and I have no need for secrecy if you find any
vulnerabilities worth reporting.

Supported Versions
------------------

When I open this up for anyone to use, I imagine I'll have a table like
this one, showing which versions I'm currently supporting:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

Also, once this is live and people's data is at stake, I imagine I'll
have to create a form somewhere for you to report vulnerabilities; but
for the moment, if you find something, just make a github issue.
